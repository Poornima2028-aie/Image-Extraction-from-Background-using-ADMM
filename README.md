# Image-Extraction-from-Background-using-ADMM
Implementation of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for background–foreground separation in images and videos. The project extracts moving objects (foreground) from static backgrounds by decomposing frames into low-rank and sparse components.
